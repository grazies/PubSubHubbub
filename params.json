Please, [read it here](http://pubsubhubbub.github.io/PubSubHubbub/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html).\r\n\r\nOpen hubs are provided by:\r\n* [Superfeedr](http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/)\r\n* [Google](http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/)\r\n* Aaron Parecki: [p3k](https://switchboard.p3k.io/)\r\n* Christian Weiske: [phubb](http://phubb.cweiske.de/)\r\n\r\nSeveral other publishing platforms, like Wordpress, include their own hubs.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for tutorials on how to get started with PubSubHubbub, check the links below:\r\n* [How to PubSubHubbub](http://blog.superfeedr.com/howto-pubsubhubbub/) by Superfeedr\r\n* [How to publish and consume PubSubHubbub](http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_publish_and_consume_PubSubHubbub) on indiewebcamp.com\r\n\r\n",
